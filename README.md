# Gummy
Machine learning library written in C++
Currently the copy of Gummy only fully supports Feed forward neural networks. 
This is because I am currently expirimenting with the effects of recurrent
depth on long tearm learning of patterns using recurrent neural networks. Developement 
on Gummy will slow during the school year as it is not priority.

# Intended additions:
Recurrent networks with user set structure in recurrent and feed forward depth with
a generalized truncated backpropegation through time algorithm in order to allow for
expirimentation with different recurrent structures. Eventually a genetic algorithm 
for this expirimentation is the goal to compete with the NEAT algorithms currently used.

### Deep Q learning
### NEAT algoritm
### Genetic algorithm with overridable fitness and crossover functions 
### Convolutional neural networks (I think they are overdone and not much for me to improve on)
### LSTM to compete with my recurrent depth strategey 
### gradient clipping and learning rate algorithms
